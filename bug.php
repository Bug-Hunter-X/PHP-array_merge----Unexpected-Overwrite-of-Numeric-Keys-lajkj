This code snippet demonstrates a potential issue in PHP related to the usage of the `array_merge()` function when dealing with numeric keys. If two input arrays have overlapping numeric keys, `array_merge()` will overwrite values from the first array with values from the second array rather than merging them. This is due to how PHP handles numeric keys internally.

```php
<?php
$array1 = [1 => 'value1', 2 => 'value2'];
$array2 = [2 => 'value3', 3 => 'value4'];

$mergedArray = array_merge($array1, $array2);

print_r($mergedArray);
// Output: Array ( [1] => value1 [2] => value3 [3] => value4 ) 
// Notice that 'value2' is overwritten by 'value3'
?>
```
